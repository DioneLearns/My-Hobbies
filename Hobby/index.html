<h2>My favourite books</h2>
<p>My favourite children's books are the timeless classics that spark imagination. I love the wild adventure of Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are, the joyful transformation in Eric Carle's The Very Hungry Caterpillar, and the soothing, rhythmic bedtime ritual of <cite>Margaret Wise Brown's Goodnight Moon.</cite> These stories hold a special magic that can be revisited at any age</p>

<h2>My favourite games.</h2>
<p>My favourite games are the tough-as-nails classic platformers that defined a generation, like Dangerous Dave, Super Mario Bros., and Mega Man 2. These games are remembered for their challenging gameplay, pixelated creativity, and the strong feeling of accomplishment they provide. I value them for their focus on player skill and their significant role in video game history</p>

<h2>My favourite colouring books</h2>
<p>My favourite childhood activity was colouring. It was a peaceful world of creativity, where a simple black-and-white page could be transformed with a box of wax crayons. I loved the feeling of choosing the perfect colour for each section and the smooth, waxy sound of the crayon filling the space. It wasn't about staying inside the lines, but about bringing my own imaginative world to life.</p>
